# OrderManager

## Note: This project is not finished and still in progress

I started creating a wpf program, which can communicate with a sql database to create, delete and change orders. In the database I implemented orders and processes, where any order can have several processes. Until now this program only interacts with orders.

The main purpose of this program is for myself to learn more about mvvm patterns and object orientation. As I started developing, I got more and more feature ideas, which I just implemented for fun. The more complex the project becomes, the more I realise that I have to adhere to the solid principles.

## Features
- Listview with the order entries.
- Create, delete and update orders.

Here I provided some screenshots with the features.
